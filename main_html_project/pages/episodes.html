<h1>Episodes</h1>
    <p>Season One of ‘House of the Dragon’ has wrapped up and it will be a 
        while until fans get to see the next installment. Here’s a look back 
        at what happened.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><h2>Episode One</h2></li>
        <h3>The Heirs of the Dragon</h3>
        <p>The episode gives us the first taste of the grizzly scenes 
        that take place in Westeros with Daemon, as commander of 
        the City Watch, leads his men on a bloodthirsty rampage 
        through King’s Landing to clean up the filth as it were. 
        We also see the rivalry between him and Ser Criston Col 
        develop and play out in what is supposed to be a celebratory 
        jousting competition for the birth of what King Viserys 
        hopes is a son.</p><br>
        <li><h2>Episode Two</h2></li>
        <h3>The Rogue Prince</h3>
        <p>Although King Viserys has chosen an heir,
             the small counsel have other plans and 
             call on the sovereign to take another bride to 
             potential sire a son and ensure a line of succession. 
             This leads to one of the more uncomfortable scenes where 
             the twelve-year-old Lady Laena (Nova Foueillis-Mosé), 
             daughter of Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys, is presented. 
             However, HBO didn’t go down that road and chose instead to
              get the king hitched to Alicent.
        </p><br>
        <li><h2>Episode Three</h2></li>
        <h3>Episode Three: Second of His Name</h3>
        <p>The marriage to Alicent has been fruitful, roughly 
            three years after the last episode the couple have 
            a son and another on the way. Their first born, Aegon, 
            is named after the great Aegon Targaryen the Conqueror, 
            thus the episodes name. 
        </p><br>
        <li><h2>Episode Four</h2></li>
        <h3>King of the Narrow Sea</h3>
        <p>The fourth episode sees the fight, literally, to 
            have the hand of Rhaenyra. While this installment 
            is more about court intrigue and Targaryen “queer” 
            incestuous customs. The princess agrees to marry Ser 
            Laenor Velaryon making the realm’s security stronger, 
            but she has her father get rid of Otto Hightower as the 
            Hand for his maneuvering to get his grandson Aegon to 
            be the heir over Rhaenyra.
        </p><br>
        <li><h2>Episode Five</h2></li>
        <h3>We Light the Way</h3>
        <p>The Iron Throne has not been kind to Viserys and sores 
            that have formed from pricking himself have gotten to 
            what looks like a dangerously unhealthy place. Meanwhile, 
            Alicent, while she didn’t like being used by her family 
            to further their position in the realm is no fan of her 
            father being turfed out of town. She shows up to the 
            wedding wearing her family’s banner color for war, emerald 
            green, and makes sure everyone notices.
        </p><br>
        <li><h2>Episode Six</h2></li>
        <h3>The Princess and the Queen</h3>
        <p>Episode six finds everyone a bit older and new children galore. 
            Rhaenyra has two older boys and a third one born during the episode, 
            all fathered by Harwin Strong. Daemon has found a new wife, Laena, 
            and they have a couple of children as well, but the birth of a third 
            doesn’t go well and she chooses to die by dragon fire.
        </p><br>
        <li><h2>Episode Seven</h2></li>
        <h3>Driftmark</h3>
        <p>Rhaenyra and Daemon plot to get the upper hand over Alicent,
             once they are free to marry each other making a stronger claim 
             to the throne when Viserys dies. Laenor’s death is staged and 
             he gets to live happily ever after with his lover, at least we hope so.
        </p><br>
        <li><h2>Episode Eight</h2></li>
        <h3>The Lord of the Tides</h3>
        <p>Viserys, surprisingly is still alive, if you can call it that, 
            as a walking rotting corpse. He shares Aegon’s vision with
             Alicent of a prophecy about the end of the world of men 
             that was called “A Song of Ice and Fire.” This convinces 
             her that it shall be her son Aegon who should be king. He 
             shows just how suitable he would be for the job by 
             assaulting Dyana, one of the nannies raising Alicent’s 
             grandchildren.
        </p><br>
        <li><h3>Episode Nine</h3></li>
        <h3>The Green Council</h3>
        <p>The conspiracy to make Aegon the next king instead of 
            Rhaenyra was not just being plotted by Alicent and her 
            father. Upon the death of King Viserys, it comes to light 
            that the small council had been planning for that all along. 
            Any dissent on the matter is dealt with quickly, sorry Lord 
            Lyman, and all others that don’t bend the knee immediately 
            head off to the gallows.
