    <h2>"What is this brief, mortal life, if not the pursuit of legacy?"</h2>
    <p>- Corlys Velaryon</p>
    <p> One of my favourite quotes from HBO's <em>"House Of The Dragon"</em>. 
        The series that was recently aired, which I personally enjoyed 
        so much that it compelled me to finally sit through all eight seasons 
        of <em>"Game Of Thrones"</em>, it's sequel.</p><br>
    <h3>A Quick Summary, Courtesy Of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon">Wikipedia</a></h3>
        <p>House of the Dragon is an American fantasy drama television series. An independent prequel 
            to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second show in the franchise, created by George 
            R. R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik are the showrunners. 
         Based on parts of the novel Fire & Blood, the series is set about 200 years before the 
         events of Game of Thrones, 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen, descendant 
         of the eponymous royal house, and 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest. 
         Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the beginning of the end of House Targaryen, 
         the events leading up to and covering the Targaryen civil war of succession, known as the 
         "Dance of the Dragons".
